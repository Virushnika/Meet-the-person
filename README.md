# Meet-the-person
This Java program reads user input for age (int), height (float), and name (string) using Scanner. It first takes the integer and float values, then reads the full line for the name. Finally, it prints a formatted output showing the personâ€™s name, age, and height (with two decimal places) in a descriptive sentence.
